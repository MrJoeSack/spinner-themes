# Lessons Learned

| Topic | Lesson |
|-------|--------|
| **Commit Messages** | Keep under 3 words: "Update", "Add files". Had to rewrite 3 commits for being too verbose. Public repo history is visible. |
| **GitHub SVGs** | GitHub strips CSS animations for security. Animated demos must use GIF format. |
| **Spinner Characters** | Claude Code uses braille `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏` not ASCII. Color is #ff8700 (ANSI 208). 100ms rotation. Shimmer is brightness pulse, not red. |
| **Spinner Verbs** | Must be -ing action verbs. Wrong: "Say my name". Right: "Saying my name". Hyphenate phrases: "Per-my-last-emailing". |
| **Thumbnails** | Avoid faces. Use sketch style with diagonal hatching. Visual metaphors over literal depictions. Hand-drawn look, not vector. |
